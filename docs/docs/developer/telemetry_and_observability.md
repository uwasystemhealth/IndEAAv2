Telemetry and Observability helps us developers to understand how our services are used and to improve our services.

## Tools used in IndEAA

### HotJar (Frontend)
See [hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/). This tool enables us to see how the user interacts. This is **qualitative** data on the interaction of the user.

In terms of pricing, we don't expect a huge load, so we just stick to "free" pricing. Anything that drops out is not much of our concern.
